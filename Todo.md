TODO LIST:
==========

- Branding work: Logo etc
- Power up towers (beacons)
- Actual pathfinding algorithms
- Sprites for character upgrades
- Better path detection
- Upgrade the wave system, i.e. tweaking numbers and spawning algorithms
- NOTES FROM GAMEPLAY: Need to figure out HP + DMG scaling.

IDEAS LIST:
===========

- The game is currently too easy: perhaps more enemy variety/ boss waves (i.e. every 5 or so)
- Along the same vein, probably need to weaken towers a decent bit, playing this game I had no difficulty getting to wave 14 just sitting in towers,
and it got boring quickly.
