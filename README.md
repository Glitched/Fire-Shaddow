# Fire-Shadow

This is an indie tower defence/role-playing survival hybrid game developed by Arjun Bhalla (ArjunBhalla98) and Ryan Slama (Glitched).

It's built entirely in Python, and makes extensive use of the pygame library.

Currently, it's very much in a pre-Alpha stage, as we're both full time University students, but very much are enjoying designing this 
as a side project. When it gets to a releaseable stage, we will likely compile to C using something like Cython, and release it for download
/on a website/ on Steam.

If you'd like to play it, download all the files/pull req, navigate to the main folder using your command prompt, and run main.py. On most 
machines, you should be able to do this by typing:

python main.py

into the command line and waiting a second or two.
